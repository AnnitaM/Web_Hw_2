    <h2>What is an axolotl?</h2>
    <p style="color:rgb(3, 3, 22)">As legend has it, the axolotl is the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, which
        disguised himself as a salamander to avoid being sacrificed. But these Mexican amphibians are impressive enough
        on their own, with the ability to regenerate lost limbs and stay <em>young</em> throughout their lives.

        Unlike other salamanders that undergo metamorphosis, axolotls (pronounced ACK-suh-LAH-tuhl) never outgrow their
        larval, juvenile stage, a phenomenon called neoteny.

        Their youthful traits include feathery gills sprouting from their heads like a mane, webbed feet, a dorsal fin
        that runs down the length of their body, and a tail. Though they keep their gills, adult axolotls also have
        functional lungs and can breathe through their skin. And as if being forever-babies didn't make them cute
        enough, their mouths are upturned in a permanent Mona Lisa smile.

        Those sweet little smiles can quickly turn into vacuum cleaners when it's time to eat. Axolotls suck in their
        prey, which includes crustaceans, mollusks, insect eggs and small fish.
